# A-Frame

Trying out: https://aframe.io/

More resources: https://github.com/aframevr/awesome-aframe#components

## Plan

Doing stuff in this order:

 - hello world
 - user mouse/click/keyboard interaction
 - primitive shapes
 - loading textures
 - model loading

## Notes

### 01 Texture

Texture images must be a power-of-2 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256,
512, 1024, etc) in each dimension.

Transparencies don't work.

These problems could be a function of the shader used.
