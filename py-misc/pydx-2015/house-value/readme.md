The guy's code: (NOTE: don't just run it):

For realestate api use Zillow api.

Keep all meta-data for images. Keep track of everything. For machine 
learning you need at least 3 sets:

	- training (builds the actual model)
	- testing (tests the performance of the model)
	- cross validation (make sure the model works in the real world)

Divide it as: (train, test, validate) = (70%, 20%, 10%).
